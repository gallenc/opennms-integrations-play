# notes

OpenNMS protobuf file is here 
https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/opennms-29.0.10-1/features/kafka/producer/src/main/proto/opennms-kafka-producer.proto

However this is not directly used in the OpenNMS build but hard coded into the model here
https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/opennms-29.0.10-1/features/kafka/producer/src/main/java/org/opennms/features/kafka/producer/model/OpennmsModelProtos.java
